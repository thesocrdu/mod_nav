Your interactions with your classmates will typically be inspired by the homework assignment problems. The assignments are sometime simple exercises meant to remind you of topics you have covered in previous terms. However, the homework problems are more often designed to illustrate the complexities of navigation problems, and thus to provoke discussion. You should initiate discussion threads on any homework problem, and on any topic of interest. I will also “seed” the discussion for a particular topic based on feedback and input from you.

To begin, please respond to the following prompt: What questions from the first assignment either surprised or puzzled you? What topics, if any, are of special interest to you? What thoughts, comments, or questions, if any, do you wish to share with the instructor and your classmates?
